abstract: Online videos have become a prevalent means for people to acquire information. Videos, however, are often polarized, misleading, or contain topics on which people have different, contradictory views. In this work, we introduce natural language explanations to stimulate more deliberate reasoning about videos and raise users’ awareness of potentially deceiving or biased information. With these explanations, we aim to support users in actively deciding and reflecting on the usefulness of the videos. We generate the explanations through an end-to-end pipeline that extracts reflection triggers so users receive additional information to the video based on its source, covered topics, communicated emotions, and sentiment. In a between-subjects user study, we examine the effect of showing the explanations for videos on three controversial topics. Besides, we assess the users’ alignment with the video’s message and how strong their belief is about the topic. Our results indicate that respondents’ alignment with the video’s message is critical to evaluate the video’s usefulness. Overall, the explanations were found to be useful and of high quality. While the explanations do not influence the perceived usefulness of the videos compared to only seeing the video, people with an extreme negative alignment with a video’s message perceived it as less useful (with or without explanations) and felt more confident in their assessment. We relate our findings to cognitive dissonance since users seem to be less receptive to explanations when the video’s message strongly challenges their beliefs. Given these findings, we provide a set of design implications for explanations grounded in theories on reducing cognitive dissonance in light of raising awareness about online deception.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces natural language explanations designed to promote more thoughtful reasoning about online videos and increase awareness of potentially biased or misleading content. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that extracts reflection triggers about video sources, topics, emotions, and sentiment to help users actively evaluate video usefulness. Our between-subjects study examining controversial topics reveals that users' alignment with video messages significantly impacts perceived usefulness. While explanations were rated highly, they didn't alter overall usefulness perceptions compared to videos alone. Notably, users with extreme negative alignment found videos less useful regardless of explanations and were more confident in their assessments. We interpret these findings through cognitive dissonance theory and propose design implications for explanations aimed at raising awareness about online deception.
