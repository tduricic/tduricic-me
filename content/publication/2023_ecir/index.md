abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of adapting a real-time recommender system to multiple application domains, and their underlying data models and customization requirements. To do that, we present Uptrendz, a multi-domain recommendation platform that can be customized to provide real-time recommendations in an API-centric way.We demonstrate (i) how to set up a real-time movie recommender us-ing the popular MovieLens-100k dataset, and (ii) how to simultaneously support multiple application domains based on the use-case of recommendations in entrepreneurial start-up founding. For that, we dfferentiate between domains on the item- and system-level. We believe that our demonstration shows a convenient way to adapt, deploy and evaluate a recommender system in an API-centric way. The source-code and documentation that demonstrates how to utilize the configured Uptrendz API is available on GitHub.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Uptrendz is a multi-domain recommendation platform offering real-time, API-centric recommendations across varied applications. Demonstrated with both MovieLens-100k movie recommendations and entrepreneurial start-up founding use cases, it distinguishes between item and system-level domains for flexible customization, deployment and evaluation. Code and documentation available on GitHub.
