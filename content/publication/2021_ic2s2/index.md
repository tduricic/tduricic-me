abstract: This study examines the cross-platform influence of content sharing by analyzing language patterns in YouTube comments before and after videos are linked on Reddit's r/conspiracy subreddit. Analyzing 859 videos from three channels and over 180,000 comments, we found that user language in YouTube comments significantly shifts toward r/conspiracy's linguistic patterns following Reddit exposure, as measured by TF-IDF representations and Jensen-Shannon divergence. While sentiment and subjectivity remain unchanged, the lexical content shows meaningful convergence with the conspiracy forum's discourse. These findings provide evidence of cross-platform influence on user language when content is shared between social media platforms, contributing to our understanding of information flow in online ecosystems.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study examines how language in YouTube comments changes after videos are shared on Reddit's conspiracy forum. Analyzing 859 videos and 180,000+ comments, we found YouTube comments adopt linguistic patterns similar to r/conspiracy after Reddit exposure, evidenced by reduced text distribution distances. While sentiment remains unchanged, vocabulary measurably shifts toward conspiracy forum discourse, demonstrating cross-platform influence on user language.
