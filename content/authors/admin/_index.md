My name is Tomislav Duricic, and I am a PhD candidate and university assistant at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home). In addition to my academic role, I serve as a software/ML engineer and scientific researcher at the [Fair AI Lab](https://www.know-center.at/research/forschung-am-know-center/fair-ai/) in the [Know-Center](https://www.know-center.at/). There, I have played a significant role in various industry and EU-funded projects, and even lead internal and external projects.

I earned my MSc and BSc degrees in Software Engineering and Information Systems from the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en) at the [University of Zagreb](http://www.unizg.hr/homepage/). Currently, my PhD research at the [Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/home) focuses on *"Sparsity and Interpretability Issues in Social-based Recommender Systems."* My primary research interests encompass recommender systems, social and complex networks, graph neural networks, user modeling and personalization, information retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing, and computational social science.

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy spending time on the [basketball court](https://www.crohoops.com/team/gold-diggers/), running on the track, or attending music events.
