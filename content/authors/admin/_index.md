I'm Tomislav Đuričić, a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at [Know Center Research](https://www.know-center.at/) in Graz, Austria. I'm pursuing my PhD at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home), focusing on "Beyond-Accuracy Optimization in Social-based Recommender Systems." I work primarily in the [Fair AI Lab](https://www.know-center.at/research/forschung-am-know-center/fair-ai/), developing advanced AI solutions for industry and research applications.

My work bridges academic research with industry applications. I've developed recommendation systems for student job platforms, time-series forecasting solutions for automotive inventory planning, and outlier detection systems for retail optimization. In my research, I explore graph neural networks, trust-based recommender systems, and evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy, publishing findings in venues like RecSys, ECAI, and ASONAM. Throughout my career, I've led both research-focused and industry-oriented projects, including initiatives funded by the European Union.

My research interests include recommender systems, graph neural networks, trust networks, and user modeling. I'm currently focused on integrating large language models into immersive AR/VR environments for industrial applications, creating digital twins that enhance machine operation and training.

I earned my MSc and BSc in Software Engineering and Information Systems from the [University of Zagreb](http://www.unizg.hr/homepage/)'s [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball with the [Gold Diggers](https://www.crohoops.com/team/gold-diggers/), jogging, and attending music events.
