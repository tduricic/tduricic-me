## Project Overview _(March 2016 â€“ December 2016)_

At Know Center Research, I developed a machine learning system for a digital photo printing company. The system intelligently assigned user-uploaded images to appropriate calendar months, significantly enhancing the user experience by automating photo selection.

**Quick Highlights:**

- End-to-end ML pipeline analyzing image metadata
- Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, Apache Solr, PySpark, Weka
- Achieved substantial accuracy improvements over manual/random assignments
- Scalable solution suitable for production workloads

## Technical Challenges

Key challenges addressed included:

- Designing a scalable microservices architecture for image processing
- Extracting and analyzing relevant image metadata efficiently
- Developing accurate predictive models for assigning images to calendar months
- Establishing a robust, scalable data pipeline

## Technologies & Methods

The solution leveraged various technologies and approaches:

- **Architecture:** Microservices using Java 8, Spring Boot, Swagger, and RabbitMQ
- **Data Storage:** Apache Solr for efficient metadata indexing and retrieval
- **Machine Learning:** Weka (J48, Random Forest, Naive Bayes classifiers)
- **Data Processing:** PySpark, HDFS, Hadoop, and Python for large-scale analysis and visualization
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, Maven, Git, JUnit, and integration testing for quality assurance
- **Development:** IntelliJ IDEA, Agile methodology with Scrum

## Results & Impact

- Significantly improved accuracy in month assignment compared to manual/random assignments
- Robust handling of images with incomplete metadata
- Enhanced user experience through streamlined calendar creation
- Delivered a scalable, reliable system capable of production deployment

## Personal Contribution

As the primary developer on this project, I:

- Designed and implemented the data extraction pipeline
- Conducted feature engineering and classifier evaluations using Weka
- Performed large-scale data analysis using PySpark and Hadoop
- Developed scalable microservices architecture adhering to industry best practices
- Created comprehensive test suites (JUnit, integration tests)
- Authored detailed project documentation
