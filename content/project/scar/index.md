## Project Overview _(March 2015 â€“ December 2020, ongoing occasionally)_

At Know Center Research, I have extensively contributed to ScaR (Scalable Recommender), our in-house recommender framework designed for real-time, scalable, and context-aware recommendation scenarios. ScaR follows a microservices architecture, integrating seamlessly with streaming data to provide immediate recommendations without costly recalculations. More information about ScaR is available on the [official project website](https://www.know-center.at/demos/scar-recommender-service/).

## Key Projects Using ScaR

- Master's thesis on social-based recommendation algorithms
- Student job matchmaking in collaboration with Studo
- Matchmaking on the VHDD platform
- Personalized learning content recommendations in the Cogsteps project
- Adaptive conference session recommendations with Conference Navigator

## Technical Challenges

- Immediate processing of high-frequency streaming data
- Scalability in cloud-based and distributed environments
- Integration of diverse recommendation algorithms
- Real-time updates without performance degradation

## Technologies & Methods

- **Core Development:** Java, Apache Solr, Spring Boot, Microservices Architecture
- **Data Management & Processing:** Real-time data ingestion and handling using Apache Solr's near-real-time features
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment:** Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Apache ZooKeeper
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Approaches
- **Testing & Maintenance:** JUnit, comprehensive unit, and integration testing

## Results & Impact

- Enabled multiple successful commercial and research projects
- Improved recommendation accuracy and speed across various use cases
- Featured in many academic publications, with the main reference:
