## Project Overview _(January 2020 â€“ December 2023)_

The **DDAI** Comet Module is a research initiative that integrates privacy-preserving, explainable, and verifiable techniques into data-driven AI systems. Funded through the COMET programme (Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies), the project combines machine learning, cryptography, and interpretability methods to deliver secure and understandable AI solutions.

The project involves collaboration between the Know Center Research, Graz University of Technology, and numerous international academic and industrial partners. Additional details can be found on the [DDAI project website](https://ddai.know-center.at/).

## My Contribution

My PhD research was partly funded by the DDAI project, enabling me to focus on explainability in recommender systems, graph-based machine learning, and modeling user behavior and preferences. My work specifically involved:

- Researching methods for enhancing interpretability and transparency in recommender systems.
- Evaluating novel approaches to graph embeddings and graph neural networks.
- Modeling user behavior and preferences to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations, particularly exploring aspects such as homophily and diversity.
- Collaborative research within interdisciplinary teams.

I authored several key publications and contributed significantly to additional studies within the project. Please find the full publication list below.
