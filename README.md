# Personal Academic Website

This repository hosts the source code for my personal academic website, created using the [Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic). The website showcases my academic background, research interests, and publications.

For more information about the Hugo Academic Theme and how to create your own website using it, visit the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) website.
